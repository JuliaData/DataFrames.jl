But it is almost addictive-like seeing pennies and nickels and an occasional quarter on the street. You want to pick it up rather than walk by it. With a little effort it adds up. But I can see why some Turkers are not honest-you can't make money by taking your time and doing a good job. That ruins it for us who do try to follow directions-the hits get complex and convoluted beyond the ability to do them sometimes because Requesters are trying to catch Turkers who really don't try.,

I have started to believe in myself and the journey has been so enriching. I just love this place and when we get paid for something we love - nothing like it.



Thanks to mturk.","Mturk has been elevating in all respect. It gives me immense joy to have my approval rate going up and also feels upsetting after a downturn in the rate. Day before yesterday, when my rate went down considerably for a 19 hit rejection, I was shattered. I still am. apparently, it was due to mistake from the requester's part who personally apologised and I really appreciate. But the fact of the matter remained. My rating went down. 



I just wish mturk has certain kinda access and privilege to intervene to fix such mistakes. At the end of the day my percentage will NOT be the same.



Thanks."
