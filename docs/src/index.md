## What is DataFrames.jl?

DataFrames.jl provides a set of tools for working with tabular data in Julia.
Its design and functionality are similar to those of
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (in Python) and `data.frame`, `data.table`
and dplyr (in R), making it  a great general purpose data science tool,
especially for those  coming to Julia from R or Python.

DataFrames.jl plays a central role in the Julia Data ecosystem, and has tight
integrations with a range of different libraries. DataFrames.jl isn't the only
tool for working with tabular data in Julia -- as noted below, there are some
other great libraries for certain use-cases -- but it provides great data
wrangling functionality through a familiar interface.

## DataFrames.jl and the Julia Data Ecosystem

The Julia data ecosystem can be a difficult space for new users to navigate, in
part because the Julia ecosystem tends to distribute functionality across
different libraries more than some other languages. Because many people coming
to DataFrames.jl are just starting to explore the Julia data ecosystem, below is
a list of well-supported libraries that provide different data science tools,
along with a few notes about what makes each library special, and how well
integrated they are with DataFrames.jl.


- **Statistics**
    - [StatsKit.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsKit.jl): A convenience
      meta-package which loads a set of essential packages for statistics,
      including those mentioned below in this section and DataFrames.jl itself.
    - [Statistics](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/):
      The Julia standard library comes with a wide range of statistics functionality,
      but to gain access to these functions you must call `using Statistics`.
    - [LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/):
      Like `Statistics`, many linear algebra features (factorizations, inversions, etc.)
      live in a library you have to load to use.
    - [SparseArrays](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/SparseArrays/)
      are also in the standard library but must be loaded to be used.
    - [FreqTables.jl](https://github.com/nalimilan/FreqTables.jl): Create
      frequency tables / cross-tabulations. Tightly integrated with DataFrames.jl.
    - [HypothesisTests.jl](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/):
      A range of hypothesis testing tools.
    - [GLM.jl](https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/manual/): Tools for estimating
      linear and generalized linear models. Tightly integrated with DataFrames.jl.
    - [StatsModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsModels.jl/stable/):
      For converting heterogeneous `DataFrame` into homogenous matrices for use
      with linear algebra libraries or machine learning applications that don't
      directly support `DataFrame`s. Will do things like convert categorical
      variables into indicators/one-hot-encodings, create interaction terms, etc.
    - [MultivariateStats.jl](https://multivariatestatsjl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html):
      linear regression, ridge regression, PCA, component analyses tools.
      Not well integrated with DataFrames.jl,
      but easily used in combination with `StatsModels`.
- **Machine Learning**
    - [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl):
      if you're more of an applied user, there is a single package the pulls
      from all these different libraries and provides a single, scikit-learn
      inspired API: MLJ.jl. MLJ.jl provides a common interface for a wide range
      of machine learning algorithms.
    - [ScikitLearn.jl](https://cstjean.github.io/ScikitLearn.jl/stable/):
      A Julia wrapper around the full Python scikit-learn machine learning library.
      Not well integrated with DataFrames.jl, but can be combined using StatsModels.jl.
    - [AutoMLPipeline](https://github.com/IBM/AutoMLPipeline.jl):
      A package that makes it trivial to create complex ML
      pipeline structures using simple expressions. It leverages
      on the built-in macro programming features of Julia to
      symbolically process, manipulate pipeline expressions,
      and makes it easy to discover optimal structures for
      machine learning regression and classification.
    - Deep learning:
      [KNet.jl](https://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/stable/tutorial/#Introduction-to-Knet-1)
      and [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl).
- **Plotting**
    - [Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/): Powerful, modern plotting
      library with a syntax akin to that of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
      (in Python) or `plot` (in R).
      [StatsPlots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/tutorial/#Using-Plot-Recipes-1)
      provides Plots.jl with recipes for many standard statistical plots.
    - [Gadfly.jl](http://gadflyjl.org/stable/): High-level plotting library with
      a "grammar of graphics" syntax akin to that of
      [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) (in R).
    - [VegaLite.jl](https://www.queryverse.org/VegaLite.jl/stable/): High-level
      plotting library that uses a different "grammar of graphics" syntax and has
      an emphasis on interactive graphics.
- **Data Wrangling**:
    - [Impute.jl](https://github.com/invenia/Impute.jl):
      various methods for handling missing data in vectors, matrices and tables.
    - [DataFramesMeta.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFramesMeta.jl):
      A range of convenience functions for DataFrames.jl that augment `select` and
      `transform` to provide a user experience similar to that provided by
      [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) in R.
    - [Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl): Query.jl provides a single
      framework for data wrangling that works with a range of libraries, including
      DataFrames.jl, other tabular data libraries (more on those below), and even
      non-tabular data. Provides many convenience functions analogous to those in
      dplyr in R or [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query).
    - You can find more on both of these packages in the
      [Data manipulation frameworks](@ref) section of this manual.
- **And More!**
    - [LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl): A pure-Julia,
      high performance network analysis library. Edgelists in `DataFrame`s can be
      easily converted into graphs using the
      [GraphDataFrameBridge.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphDataFrameBridge.jl)
      package.
- **IO**:
    - DataFrames.jl work well with a range of formats, including
      CSVs (using [CSV.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl)),
      Apache Arrow (using [Arrow.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Arrow.jl))
      Stata, SPSS, and SAS files (using [StatFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/StatFiles.jl)),
      and reading and writing parquet files (using [Parquet.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Parquet.jl)).

While not all of these libraries are tightly integrated with DataFrames.jl,
because `DataFrame`s are essentially collections of aligned Julia vectors, so it
is easy to (a) pull out a vector for use with a non-DataFrames-integrated
library, or (b) convert your table into a homogenously-typed matrix using the
`Matrix` constructor or StatsModels.jl.

### Other Julia Tabular Libraries

DataFrames.jl is a great general purpose tool for data manipulation and
wrangling, but it's not ideal for all applications. For users with more
specialized needs, consider using:

- [TypedTables.jl](https://juliadata.github.io/TypedTables.jl/stable/):
  Type-stable heterogeneous tables. Useful for improved performance when the
  structure of your table is relatively stable and does not feature thousands of
  columns.
- [JuliaDB.jl](https://juliadata.github.io/JuliaDB.jl/stable/): For users
  working with data that is too large to fit in memory, we suggest JuliaDB.jl,
  which offers better performance for large datasets, and can handle out-of-core
  data manipulations (Python users can think of JuliaDB.jl as the Julia version of
  [dask](https://dask.org/)).

Note that most tabular data libraries in the Julia ecosystem (including
DataFrames.jl) support a common interface (defined in the
[Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) package). As a result, some
libraries are capable or working with a range of tabular data structures, making
it easy to move between tabular libraries as your needs change. A user of
[Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl), for example, can use the
same code to manipulate data in a `DataFrame`, a `Table` (defined by
TypedTables.jl), or a JuliaDB table.

## API

Only exported (i.e. available for use without `DataFrames.` qualifier after
loading the DataFrames.jl package with `using DataFrames`) types and functions
are considered a part of the public API of the DataFrames.jl package. In general
all such objects are documented in this manual (in case some documentation is
missing please kindly report an issue
[here](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/issues/new)).

All types and functions that are part of public API are guaranteed to go through
a deprecation period before being changed or removed.

Please be warned that while Julia allows you to access internal functions or
types of DataFrames.jl these can change without warning between versions of
DataFrames.jl. In particular it is not safe to directly access fields of types
that are a part of public API of the DataFrames.jl package using e.g. the
`getfield` function. Whenever some operation on fields of defined types is
considered allowed an appropriate exported function should be used instead.
